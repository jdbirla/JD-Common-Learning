Application: Ideal for systems where events trigger actions, fostering scalability and responsiveness.

2 - Layered Architecture
Hierarchical Structure with Distinct Layers (Presentation, Business Logic, Data).
Application: Common in enterprise applications, enhancing maintainability through compartmentalization and modular development.

3 - Monolithic Architecture
Unified Codebase and Deployment Unit.
Application: Suited for smaller applications or simplicity-focused instances. Streamlines development and deployment with potential scaling challenges.

4 - Microservices Architecture
Distributed System with Independent, Interoperable Services.
Application: Ideal for large and intricate systems, improving scalability, fault isolation, and enabling independent service development.

5 - Model-View-Controller (MVC)
Segregation of Concerns into Model, View, and Controller Components.
Application: Common in web applications, enhancing code organization and maintenance by separating complex UI logic.

6 - Master-Slave Architecture
Centralized Control (Master) with Multiple Worker Nodes (Slaves).
Application: Ubiquitous in distributed computing, optimizing parallel processing and load balancing.

## Core Components of System Architecture
[Distributed Messaging Queues]
Enables seamless communication between different components of a system, ensuring efficient message exchange.

[DNS (Domain Name System)]
Facilitates the translation of user-friendly domain names into IP addresses, enabling browsers to locate web servers on the internet.

[Load Balancer]
Distributes incoming web traffic across multiple servers, ensuring optimal resource utilization and preventing overload on individual servers.

[Distributed Caching]
Stores frequently used data efficiently, reducing the need for repeated retrieval from slower databases.

[Database]
Organizes, stores, and retrieves data, serving as a central hub for various applications and services.

[Distributed Task Scheduler]
Efficiently organizes and assigns tasks across different system components, ensuring coordinated operations.

[Observability]
Provides insights into system performance, aiding issue identification and maintaining optimal functioning.

[Unstructured Data Storage]
Accommodates various data types without requiring predefined structures, offering flexibility.

[Scaling Services]
Enables the system to handle increased traffic and demand by expanding its capacity.

[Publish-Subscribe Model]
Facilitates communication between different system parts without direct connections.

[Unique ID Generator]
Creates distinct identifiers for each piece of data, ensuring data integrity and uniqueness.

[Rate-Limiting]
Controls the flow of requests to maintain a steady and manageable pace, preventing strain on the system.

## 𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐑𝐄𝐒𝐓 𝐀𝐏𝐈 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤?
At its core, 𝐑𝐄𝐒𝐓 (𝐑𝐞𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐟𝐞𝐫) is an architectural style that provides a set of constraints for designing networked applications. REST APIs serve as the building blocks for communication between different software components, enabling them to request and exchange data seamlessly.

Here's a simplified breakdown of REST API for you!

𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐜𝐞𝐬: REST revolves around resources, which can be anything from a user profile to a product catalog. Each resource is uniquely identified by a URL, forming the basis for interactions.

𝐇𝐓𝐓𝐏 𝐕𝐞𝐫𝐛𝐬: REST APIs make use of the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform actions on resources. For instance, a GET request retrieves data, while a POST request creates new data.

𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: One of REST's key principles is statelessness. Each request to a REST API should contain all the information needed to understand and process it, making the interactions independent of one another.

𝐔𝐧𝐢𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐞: REST APIs have a consistent and uniform interface that follows conventions. This predictability simplifies development and integration.

𝐑𝐞𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Resources are represented in a format, often JSON or XML. This representation is sent between the client and server to carry information.

𝐂𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭-𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐀𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞: REST emphasizes the separation between clients (the user interface) and servers (the data storage and processing), allowing for greater scalability and flexibility.

So, the next time you interact with an app on your smartphone, think about how REST APIs enable it to fetch your latest messages, update your profile, or show you the news. REST is the behind-the-scenes magician that ensures everything works seamlessly.

Let's keep the conversation going and demystify the tech that powers our digital world!

## Single Sign-On (SSO) explained in simple terms.

### 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗦𝗦𝗢

1. User - The individual seeking access to applications
2. Identity Provider (IDP) - Authenticates users (e.g. Google, Facebook)
3. Application - The software or service the user wants to access

### 𝗕𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗳𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗦𝗦𝗢

- Simplifies access with one set of credentials
- Enhances user experience
- Reduces password fatigue
- Centralizes security and access management
- Improves security
- Streamlines access control
- Simplifies compliance reporting
- Allows seamless integration

### 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗦𝗦𝗢 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀

- User tries to log into an application
- Application redirects user to SSO/IDP
- IDP authenticates user
- IDP issues authenticated token
- Token sent back to browser
- Browser presents token to application
- Application grants access without re-entering credentials

This streamlined process enables single login access to multiple applications, improving convenience and security.

Over to you: With SSO facilitating access across various platforms, what measures do you consider essential to maintain the integrity and security of user identities?

## How DNS Works - A Simplified Overview
[1] User Types a URL:
A user enters a website's URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into their browser.
[2] Browser Contacts DNS Resolver:
The browser checks its local DNS resolver (usually provided by the internet service provider) to find the IP address associated with the entered domain.
[3] DNS Resolver Searches Cache:
The DNS resolver checks its cache for a previously resolved IP address for the requested domain. If found, the process skips to the next step.
[4] Recursive DNS Query:
If the resolver doesn't have the IP address, it starts a recursive query. It contacts the root DNS server, asking for information about the top-level domain (TLD) of the requested site.
[5] Root DNS Server Response:
The root DNS server responds with the TLD DNS server's address.
[6] TLD DNS Server Inquiry:
The resolver contacts the TLD DNS server, asking for information about the authoritative DNS server for the specific domain.
[7] Authoritative DNS Server Contact:
The TLD DNS server responds with the IP address of the authoritative DNS server for the domain.
[8] Domain's Authoritative DNS Server Response:
The resolver contacts the authoritative DNS server, requesting the IP address associated with the domain.
[9] Authoritative DNS Server Provides IP:
The authoritative DNS server responds with the IP address of the requested domain.
[10] DNS Resolver Caches IP:
The DNS resolver caches the obtained IP address for future use and sends it to the user's browser.
[11] Browser Connects to IP Address:
The browser uses the obtained IP address to connect to the web server hosting the requested website.
