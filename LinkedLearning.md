## 6 Must Know Software Architectural Patterns
1 - Event-Driven Architecture
Decoupled Components and Asynchronous Communication.
Application: Ideal for systems where events trigger actions, fostering scalability and responsiveness.

2 - Layered Architecture
Hierarchical Structure with Distinct Layers (Presentation, Business Logic, Data).
Application: Common in enterprise applications, enhancing maintainability through compartmentalization and modular development.

3 - Monolithic Architecture
Unified Codebase and Deployment Unit.
Application: Suited for smaller applications or simplicity-focused instances. Streamlines development and deployment with potential scaling challenges.

4 - Microservices Architecture
Distributed System with Independent, Interoperable Services.
Application: Ideal for large and intricate systems, improving scalability, fault isolation, and enabling independent service development.

5 - Model-View-Controller (MVC)
Segregation of Concerns into Model, View, and Controller Components.
Application: Common in web applications, enhancing code organization and maintenance by separating complex UI logic.

6 - Master-Slave Architecture
Centralized Control (Master) with Multiple Worker Nodes (Slaves).
Application: Ubiquitous in distributed computing, optimizing parallel processing and load balancing.
